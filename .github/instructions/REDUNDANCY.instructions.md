# Redundancy Guidelines

1. **Avoid Redundancy**:
   - Carefully review the existing application structure and codebase before making changes.
   - Ensure that new implementations do not duplicate existing functionality.

2. **Preserve Functionality**:
   - The application is partially functional; do not introduce changes that break existing features.
   - Test thoroughly after making modifications to confirm that the app remains operational.
